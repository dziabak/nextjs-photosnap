## Overview

**Live Site URL: [Photosnap on Vercel](https://nextjs-photosnap-chi.vercel.app/)**

This project is designed as a portfolio piece, demonstrating my ability to create a visually appealing and responsive website. It is based on the [Frontend Mentor - Photosnap multi-page website](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/photosnap-multipage-website-nMDSrNmNW). The challenge was focused on building the marketing site for a photo-sharing app, offering an opportunity to test my web-development skills. The goal was to replicate the provided design as closely as possible, ensuring optimal layout on various screen sizes and incorporating hover states for interactive elements.

### Project features

- **Modern Web Development with Next.js 14**: Leveraging the power of Next.js 14, this project represents a commitment to advancing my skills and taking web development to the next level. Even though the current version may not heavily rely on advanced data fetching, the inclusion of Next.js allowed me to delve into modern web development practices and explore the distinctions between standard React CSR and SSR.
- **React Components for Rapid Iteration**: Behind the scenes of this seemingly traditional multi-page website lies the efficiency of React components. Embracing the component-based architecture, I was able to iterate quickly, fostering code reuse and customization. This approach not only enhances maintainability but also provides a solid foundation for supporting a variety of features seamlessly.

## My process

### Built with

- React
- Next
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Vercel (build and deployment)

### What I learned

- **Embracing Advanced Web Development with Next.js 14**: Working with Next.js 14 deepened my understanding of modern web development, specifically the intricacies of SSR and how to effectively rely on client components. This became particularly evident in implementing a dynamic price toggle functionality, allowing users to seamlessly switch between monthly and yearly pricing options. The experience highlighted the importance of balancing server and client rendering for optimal user experiences.

- **Harnessing the Power of React Components for Web Pages**: The project provided a valuable opportunity to explore the versatility of React components beyond traditional application development. Building standard-looking web pages became a seamless process with React's component-based approach. Notably, creating components like the price table was not only straightforward but also remarkably easy to maintain. This experience underscored the efficiency and scalability that React components bring to crafting visually appealing and functional web pages.

### Continued development

- **Refining Component Architecture**: While the current version of the project successfully achieves its goals, there's room for improvement in the readability of certain components. Notably, the Navigation component could benefit from a refactor to streamline its structure and reduce prop-drilling. In a production-level codebase, this might be considered less than ideal; however, given the scope of this small website and the limited number of components, the current solution suffices. Future development will include revisiting and refining these components to enhance maintainability and readability.
- **Database Integration for Full-stack Capability**: In the initial stages of development, the focus was primarily on the front-end, and data for generating page content was stored in a data.ts file. As part of my ongoing learning journey with Next.js, the next phase will involve delving into backend integration. The goal is to explore database integration with Next.js, unlocking the full potential of the framework and enabling SSR for dynamic and data-driven web applications. This evolution will not only enhance the scalability of the project but also broaden my skill set as a full-stack developer.
